# Monetate_Track for Magento v1.x
Originally written by [OnePica](https://github.com/onepica)  (assumedly contracted by Monetate) and provided under OSL3.0. Hosted here to continue bug fixes and compatibility with EE v1.14.x. (and up?) since they may have ceased to be and people still use Magento 1. No guarantees...
## Description
Module for Monetate allows to use an event handler which adds a tracking script for each page. This handler will add methods with parameters, based on current location, actions, to a global object. An XML data feed will be created to send product data to Monetate.
## Current Version
v1.0.1 was last released on March 23rd, 2015. Last changelog entry was:
>Changed functionality to move Monetate Tag script before other scripts
Compatibility is listed for EEv1.12-v1.14
## Updates
Any updates to this code will be made as issues are discovered... if you use this (seemingly moribund) code, and discover any issues, please report them in [this repository's issues](https://github.com/bangerkuwranger/Monetate_Track-Magento1.x/issues). PRs welcome.
